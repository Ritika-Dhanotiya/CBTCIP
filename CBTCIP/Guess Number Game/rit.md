ðŸ”¢ The project was a "Guess the Number" game using Java, where I implemented a random number generator,
user input handling through dialog boxes,and feedback on guesses (too high, too low, or correct).
Additionally, I added features like limiting the number of attempts, multiple rounds, and a scoring system.
